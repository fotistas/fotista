# Auction

Build with Laravel PHP Framework on server side and Angular JS on client side.

I'm planning to use angular only for real time auction and not for whole website.

##Installation

Clone, take database from "sql archive", setup your DB settings in "app/config/local/database.php" and add your hostname in "bootstrap/start.php"
